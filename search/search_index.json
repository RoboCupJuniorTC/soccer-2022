Let's talk a bit about how to do this. Too long; Didn't read (TL;DR) We expect you to submit the code of the rcj_soccer_team_blue controller. Simply add a team_name.txt file to the controllers/ directory and then zip it together (by creating a .ZIP file) with the rcj_soccer_team_blue/ folder. That gives you a submission package which you can then share with the organizers. A more in-dept tutorial can be found below. From controllers to a submission Suppose you have the folder structure which looks like this controllers/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 rcj_soccer_team_blue/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 rcj_soccer_team_blue.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot1.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot2.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot3.py | \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils.py To submit it for the competition, there are two (well, maybe three) things we need to do: 1. Add a team name 2. (Optionally) add a team logo 3. Create a ZIP archive Add a team name The folder structure above does contain some code but it is not immediately obvious which team does it belong to. To make it obvious, please create a file called team_name.txt on the same level as rcj_soccer_team_blue/ . This file should contain a single line of text: the name of the team (up to 32 characters). The resulting folder structure would then look as follows: controllers/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 rcj_soccer_team_blue/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 rcj_soccer_team_blue.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot1.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot2.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot3.py | \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 team_name.txt (Optionally) add a team logo Note: This step is completely optional and you can just skip it -- your robot controllers will still work, even if you do not provide a custom logo for your team . If you'd like, you can optionally also add a custom logo for your team's robot. It will be used as an overlay on the robots in the simulator. The logo needs to be stored in the PNG format and located in a file called logo.png . If you choose to add one, the folder structure will look something like the following: controllers/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 rcj_soccer_team_blue/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 rcj_soccer_team_blue.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot1.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot2.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot3.py | \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 logo.png \u2514\u2500\u2500 team_name.txt Create a ZIP archive This step is very simple: you just pick the directory that contains the code for your three robots, the team_name.txt file and optionally logo.png and put them all together into a single .ZIP file. There are many utilities that will do the job -- we can recommend 7-Zip . When you look into the resulting .ZIP file, the folder structure should look as follows: . \u251c\u2500\u2500 rcj_soccer_team_blue/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 rcj_soccer_team_blue.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot1.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot2.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 robot3.py | \u2514\u2500\u2500 utils.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 logo.png \u2514\u2500\u2500 team_name.txt Note that there is no controllers/ folder anymore -- the .ZIP file only contains a single rcj_soccer_team_blue/ folder and a single text file called team_name.txt (and optionally the logo.png image). Uploading your submission Once you have your .ZIP file ready, the only thing left is to submit it to the organizers. In practice, this generally means uploading it to a specific location that will be shared with all the participating teams well before the submission deadline. Things to keep in mind The resulting .ZIP file can be at most 10MB in size. The organizers will run a code similarity detector on the submitted code. Yes, wheels really do not need to be reinvented but it would really not be fair to win a competition with something that's not primarily the team's own work. Submissions with significant overlap of duplicated code will not be permitted to compete in the competition. The code you submit will be open sourced at the end of the competition. If you managed to find a bug, have any question or ran into some problem, please do not hesitate to ask on the forum .","title":"SoccerSim Code Submission"},{"location":"code-submission/#soccer-sim-code-submission","text":"To take part in the Soccer Sim challenge, the code that's powering the team's robots needs to get to the organizers.
