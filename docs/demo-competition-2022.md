# RoboCupJunior Soccer Sim Demo 2022

The RoboCupJunior Soccer Sim Demo competition is exactly what it sounds like: a
chance to try out the Webots-based Soccer Sim environment, along with the new
updates prepared for 2022. These include:

- [GPS sensor](https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccer-sim/how_to_robot/#gps)
- [Compass sensor](https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccer-sim/how_to_robot/#compass)
- [Sonars](https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccer-sim/how_to_robot/#sonars)
- [Ball IR Sensor](https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccer-sim/how_to_robot/#ball-ir-sensor)
- [Inter-robot communication](https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccer-sim/communication_between_robots/)

The "Demo" in its name refers to the fact that it is not an "official"
competition but rather sort of a trial for the official competition that will
be held in July 2022.

## Rules

The rules are based on the regular RoboCupJunior Soccer rules, adapted to the
simulation environment.

You can find them at
https://github.com/RoboCupJuniorTC/soccer-rules-simulation/blob/master/rules.pdf

**Note**: The rules haven't changed much from the last year. Perhaps the most
important change is the change of the world's coordinate system. We encourage
you to check out the sample Robot controllers as well as the
[Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/reference/worldinfo) documentation.

## Simulator

Just as in 2021, we'll use a Webots world adapted to our rules and will accept
controllers programmed in **Python 3**. The latest version of the environment
can be found on the link below. We consider the code done for the Demo 2022
competition, meaning no significant changes are expected, just bug fixes.

Check it out and let us know what you think!

## Documentation

We now have two fully fledged documentation articles that can help you get
started programming your robots:

- [How to program your robot](https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccer-sim/how_to_robot/)
- [Inter-robot communication](https://robocupjuniortc.github.io/rcj-soccer-sim/communication_between_robots/)

If you feel like there is something missing in the documentation, do not
hesitate to suggest a change -- Pull Requests are very much welcome!
